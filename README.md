Project: ESC-10 Classification using ESN Reservoir.
Author: Mohamed Hassan in fulfillment of NN Class WS23/24

Project Overview: In this undertaking, we employ the Echo State Network's dynamic reservoir of interconnected nodes to capture intricate temporal patterns present in the audio signals. The reservoir's ability to act as a dynamic memory is crucial for discerning the unique characteristics of each sound class within the dataset. The focus lies on extracting relevant features from the time domain of the audio signals to enhance classification accuracy.

Dataset - ESC-10: The ESC-10 Dataset comprising a variety of real-world environmental sounds, this dataset challenges the ESN to learn and generalize from diverse acoustic patterns. Each sound class within ESC-10 represents a distinct environmental context, ranging from natural sounds like rain and wind to urban and mechanical noises.
